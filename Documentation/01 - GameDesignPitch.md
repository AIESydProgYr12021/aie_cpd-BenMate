## Player experience and game POV 
What are the major phases of the player’s experience in the game? 
 
- The player is the last surviver. He is attempting to survive by killing all of the zombies. the fantasy the game grants the player is the feel of overcomming hordes of zombies. i want the player to feel strong and powerful but after a couple waves feel outnumbered and enter a panic state because of the number of zombies. the players game experience will be early on they will be strong and powerful but later on start to struggle. the POV will be bird eye view.

## Visual/audio Style

the expience i want to player to feel is to be stronger then the enemys and only losing because they made a bad judgment in movement.

some Screen shoots i can show are gameplay and the players health.
